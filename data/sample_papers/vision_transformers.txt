An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Vision Transformers for Computer Vision

Abstract
This paper explores the application of Transformer architectures to computer vision tasks. We demonstrate that pure Transformer models, when applied directly to sequences of image patches, can perform excellently on image classification tasks without the need for convolutional layers.

Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominant architecture in computer vision for decades. Their inductive biases - translation equivariance and locality - make them well-suited for image data. However, recent advances in attention mechanisms and Transformers in NLP have prompted researchers to reconsider these architectural assumptions.

Vision Transformer Architecture
The Vision Transformer (ViT) treats an image as a sequence of patches. An image is divided into fixed-size patches (typically 16x16 pixels), which are linearly embedded and provided to a standard Transformer encoder. A learnable classification token is prepended to the sequence, similar to BERT's [CLS] token.

Patch Embeddings
To process images, we divide them into non-overlapping patches. Each patch is flattened and linearly projected to a fixed embedding dimension. Position embeddings are added to retain positional information, as the Transformer architecture itself is permutation-invariant. This approach allows the model to process images while maintaining the Transformer's original architecture.

Self-Attention for Images
Self-attention in Vision Transformers allows each patch to attend to all other patches in the image. This global receptive field contrasts with CNNs, where receptive fields grow gradually with depth. While this provides more flexibility, it also increases computational cost, particularly for high-resolution images.

Pre-training and Transfer Learning
Vision Transformers benefit significantly from pre-training on large datasets. When pre-trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet-21k or JFT-300M, ViTs achieve excellent performance. However, with smaller datasets, CNNs often outperform ViTs due to their stronger inductive biases.

Comparison with CNNs
Unlike CNNs, Vision Transformers lack inherent translation equivariance and locality. These properties must be learned from data. While this makes ViTs more flexible, it also requires more training data. CNNs remain more sample-efficient on smaller datasets, but ViTs scale better with data.

Hybrid Architectures
Hybrid models that combine CNNs and Transformers have also been explored. These architectures use CNNs for initial feature extraction, converting images into feature maps, which are then processed by Transformer layers. This approach leverages CNN's inductive biases while benefiting from Transformer's global modeling capabilities.

Attention Visualization
Attention maps in Vision Transformers provide insights into what the model focuses on. Unlike CNNs where understanding the model's reasoning can be challenging, attention weights in ViTs directly show which patches influence predictions. This interpretability is valuable for understanding model behavior.

Computational Efficiency
The quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length presents challenges for high-resolution images. Various efficient attention mechanisms have been proposed, including window-based attention, shifted windows, and hierarchical structures that reduce computational requirements while maintaining performance.

Applications Beyond Classification
Vision Transformers have been successfully applied to various computer vision tasks beyond image classification. Object detection models like DETR (Detection Transformer) use Transformers end-to-end. Segmentation tasks benefit from Transformer's ability to capture global context. Video understanding leverages Transformers to model temporal dependencies.

Relationship to Graph Neural Networks
Interestingly, Vision Transformers can be viewed through the lens of graph neural networks. If we consider each patch as a node and attention weights as edges, ViT performs message passing on a fully connected graph. This connection suggests potential for combining insights from both GNNs and Transformers.

Future Research Directions
Future work includes improving efficiency for high-resolution images, developing better pre-training strategies, and understanding what makes Transformers effective for vision. There is also interest in unified architectures that can handle multiple modalities - vision, language, and beyond.

Conclusion
Vision Transformers represent a paradigm shift in computer vision, demonstrating that architectures designed for NLP can be successfully adapted for images. While they require substantial training data, their performance at scale and interpretability make them a promising direction for future research in computer vision.
